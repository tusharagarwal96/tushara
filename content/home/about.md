# Biography

Hello! I'm Tushar

I am a Graduate Student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kanpur. Currently, I am developing a 500 CC methanol-fueled motorcycle at <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/erl/"  target="_blank">Engine Research Laboratory</a>, under the guidance of <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~akag/"  target="_blank">Prof. Avinash K. Agarwal</a>. Apart from academic engagements, I love traveling, photography and tinkering in my free time to build cool projects.
