<font size="4">
I completed my summer internship at Pondy Tea Factory, Puducherry under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bn-gohokar-b5b87751/"  target="_blank">B. N. Gohokar</a>. My project primarily aimed at minimizing Tea dust by 30% of the current level escaping through various Tea handling and packing activities from Blending to Packing. Apart from that, I was involved in various other activities like beyond work safety assessment, software training for employees, career counseling workshop for children, voluntary work at Prabhat, etc.
