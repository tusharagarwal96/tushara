Formula SAE is an international student design competition sponsored by the Society of Automotive Engineers. The program simulates real-world engineering design projects and related challenges with the goal of developing and building a small Formula-style race car. Teams from countries around the world compete in static and dynamic events.

I extensively worked on the Powertrain Electronics of the car to improve lap timing and engine response. I initiated and lead a new subsystem to implement driver interface electronics; dash and steering wheel electronics, automatic gear shifter and actuation.

During my tenure I was also the Vice Captain for the team, leading a 3-tier team of 50 students to design and fabricate an FSAE vehicle. I delegated and administered the overall design process by supervising work on different subsystems. I was also responsible for various tasks pertaining to Public Relations, Marketing, Logistics, and Team building activities
